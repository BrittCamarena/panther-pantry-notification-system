# Panther Pantry Notification System

An admin tool developed for notifying subscribers of food inventory, events, and or/special arrivals.  Feature implementation was split amonst my college class group.  I was responsible for programming an admin page where custom or template based emails could be mass sent to registered Panther Pantry subscribers.  Additional project contributions included website branding design and programming a login portal with unique navigation based on admin/user session ID.
