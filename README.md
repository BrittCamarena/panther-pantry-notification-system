# Panther Pantry Notification System

An admin tool developed for notifying subscribers of food inventory announcements.

### Project Overview

Feature implementation was split amongst my college class group.  I was responsible for programming an admin page where custom or template based emails could be mass sent to registered Panther Pantry subscribers.  Additional project contributions included website branding design and programming a login portal with unique navigation based on admin/user session ID.

**The code presented in this repository are strictly the isolated files from my contributions to the Panther Pantry project.  Additional project features are NOT included in order to prevent false accreditation of my classmate's work to myself.**

Directories beginning with "master" were shared between all our team's project contributions.

### Key Features

- User login via AJAX call to MySQL/MSSQL database
- Unique portal tools based on Subscriber or Manager session ID
- Rigorous client-side and server-side input validation when sending notifications
- Fetch preexisting templates when composing notifications
- User logout functionality and site redirect
